# Requirements
In this solution you will find a base project dealing with Political Elections 

The main goal is to implement the business logic for both election types: Plurality & Ranked Choice. 

For Plurality, the candidate with the most votes wins. There is no minimum vote threshold. 

With Ranked Choice, you will need to consider multiple votes per ballot and their respective ranks.

# Technical
This library was created in Visual Studio 2022 using net6.0 (LTS). If this is an issue, let us know and we can send you what ever project version you need.
